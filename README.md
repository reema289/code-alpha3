The Sudoku Solver is a C++ program designed to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using the Backtracking Algorithm. It features an intuitive ghraphical user interface (GUI) to input Sudoku puzzles, and the solver will find the correct solution by iterating through possibilities while ensuring all constraints are met (row, column, and subgrid rules).
